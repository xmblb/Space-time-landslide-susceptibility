Abstract:
---

Portraying spatiotemporal variations in the landslide susceptibility patterns is crucial for landslide prevention and management. In this study, we implement a space-time modeling approach to predict the landslide susceptibility on a yearly basis across the main island of Taiwan, from 2004 to 2018. This model corresponds to a Bayesian version of a binomial Generalized Additive Model (GAM), which assumes that landslide occurrences follow a Bernoulli distribution. We generated 46,074 slope units to partition the island of Taiwan and divided the time domain into 14 annual units. The binary label assigned to each slope unit and their temporal replicates come from an available multi-temporal inventory. We used this to exclusively assign a landslide presence to slope units where landslides either represented reactivations of previous mass movements or entirely new failures. This information and its absence counterpart were regressed against a set of static and dynamic covariates. 
Our modeling strategy featured an initial explanatory model to test the goodness-of-fit and interpret the covariatesâ€™ effect. Then, five cross-validation (CV) schemes were tested to provide a full spectrum of the predictive capacity of our model. Specifically, we implemented a fully randomized 10-fold CV, a spatially constrained CV, two temporal CV (a leave one year out and a sequential temporal aggregation), together with a spatio-temporal CV. Ultimately, we summarized the performance in each of these tests, through their pure numerical expression as well as their residual representation in space and time. 
Overall, our space-time model produced excellent and interpretable results. We consider this type of dynamic prediction the new direction to take to finally move away from the static view provided by traditional susceptibility models. And, we consider such analyses just a stepping stone for further improvements, the most natural of which would lead to statistical simulations for future scenarios.

Abstract:
---

Identifying landslides and describing potential landslide areas are key to landslide prevention and management. The climate changes affect the slope stability and landslide influential factors on spatial and temporal scales. Most studies consider the landslide susceptibility as a non-temporal concept and ignore spatiotemporal impact of climate changes on predicting landslide potential areas. Here, we perform a dynamic prediction of landslide susceptibility in Taiwan from 2004 to 2015, and systematically analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of potential landslide areas under the influence of climate changes. A long sequence of landslide susceptibility distributions is constructed based on multi-temporal inventory data and dynamic influential factors. Our analysis confirms that landslide susceptibility is time-variant, and its spatial distribution should be updated over time. Moreover, the spatial distribution of landslide susceptibility in Taiwan shows distinct spatial characteristics and strong spatial variations, and landslide-prone areas are mainly distributed in the mountainous areas. Meanwhile, the center of landslide susceptibility has a clear trend of moving to the southwest from 2004 to 2010, and then showing a trend of moving to the northeast after 2010. Finally, we zone safety and unstable areas to facilitate landslide prevention and management.
